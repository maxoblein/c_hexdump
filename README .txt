*Description:
-Hexdump: Print a textual representation of the bytes from the file
-Version: Print the version (1.0) to stdout
-P2 to P5: Read a PNM file, the input is expected to be a P2 format image (ascii) and the output should be saved as P5 (binary). If the input is not a P2 format image, print the error message to stderr and exit with code 1
-P5 to P2: Read a PNM file, the input is expected to be a P5 format image (binary) and the output should be saved as P2 (ascii). If the input is not a P5 format image, print the error message to stderr and exit with code 1
-Rotate2: Read the rotate a p2 image, changes the image so that it has height W and width H, and the data that was at (row i column j) in the original image is now at (row j column i)
-Rotate5: Read and rotate a p5 image, changes the image so that it has height W and width H, and the data that was at (row i column j) in the original image is now at (row j column i)
-Rotate902: Read the rotate a P2 image, rotated CLOCKWISE by 90 degrees. Changing the image so that it has height W and width H, and the data that was at (row i column j) in the original image is now at (row j column i), then reflect the image about the central column
-Rotate905: Read the rotate a P5 image, rotated CLOCKWISE by 90 degrees. Changing the image so that it has height W and width H, and the data that was at (row i column j) in the original image is now at (row j column i), then reflect the image about the central column
-invert: this in our extension funtion it will invert the colour in the image file by taking each matrix entry and subtracting it from 255 the usual max value.





*To compile the code:
A Makefile is made in order to compile the codeï¼›

all: pnmdump.exe

pnmdump.exe: pnmdumpmain.c
  gcc -std=c99 -Wall $< -o $@

test: pnmdump.exe
  python tests/runtests-1.0.py

The exact commands: gcc pnmdumpmain.c -o pnmdumo.exe

IF IN THE DIRECTORY RUN :make test to compile and run the test file.


*Examples:
1. 
$ ./pnmdump.exe --usage
Usage: 
./pnmdump.exe --version 
./pnmdump.exe --usage 
./pnmdump.exe --hexdump [FILE]

2.
$ ./pnmdump.exe
pnmdump: bad arguments
Usage:
./pnmdump.exe --version
./pnmdump.exe --usage
./pnmdump.exe --hexdump [FILE]

3.
$ ./pnmdump.exe --hexdump Makefile
